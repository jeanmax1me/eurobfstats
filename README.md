European Boyfriend Rarity Calculator
The European Boyfriend Rarity Calculator is a small project designed for a female audience interested in understanding the rarity of their criteria when searching for a boyfriend in Europe. Inspired by the "Female Delusion Calculator," which gained popularity in the USA, this web application offers a similar experience tailored to the European dating landscape.

Key Features:
Rarity Assessment: Users can input their preferences for various boyfriend criteria, such as age, marital status, physical appearance, income, height, and more.

Statistical Data: The application utilizes data from the Eurostat database, maintained by the European Commission. To simplify calculations, the data has been averaged while still providing estimations closely aligned with reality.

Age Range Insights: The age range feature provides insights into the percentage of men within a specified age range, allowing users to gauge the prevalence of potential partners in Europe.

Marital Status Analysis: Users can explore how age influences marital status among European men, helping them make informed decisions about their dating preferences.

Looks and Attractiveness: The application considers attractiveness on a standardized distribution, helping users understand how their chosen attractiveness scale aligns with European norms.

How It Works:
Users input their desired criteria, including age preferences, marital status, minimum income, minimum height, and minimum looks.

The calculator processes these preferences and provides users with a rarity percentage and fraction, indicating how unique their preferences are within the European dating pool.

Users gain valuable insights into the rarity of their ideal European boyfriend based on their specific criteria.

The European Boyfriend Rarity Calculator aims to empower users with data-driven insights to make informed decisions in their dating journey. It's a fun and informative tool for those curious about the uniqueness of their relationship preferences in the diverse European dating landscape.
